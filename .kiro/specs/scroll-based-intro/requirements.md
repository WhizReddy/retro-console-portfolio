# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a scroll-based progressive disclosure system that introduces the user to the developer and guides them toward the main interactive element (monitor/Game Boy) in the 3D scene. The system uses scroll position to trigger different stages of user engagement, creating a smooth onboarding experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio site, I want to see an introduction about the developer when I start scrolling, so that I understand who created this experience and what I'm looking at.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls down a small amount (initial scroll threshold) THEN the system SHALL display a warning/introduction message about the developer
2. WHEN the introduction message is displayed THEN the system SHALL overlay the message on the 3D scene without blocking interaction
3. WHEN the user has not scrolled THEN the system SHALL show the clean 3D scene without any overlay messages
4. IF the user scrolls back to the top THEN the system SHALL hide the introduction message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor who has seen the introduction, I want to be guided toward the main interactive element as I continue scrolling, so that I know what to interact with next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls beyond the introduction threshold (deeper scroll) THEN the system SHALL display guidance directing them to the monitor/Game Boy
2. WHEN the guidance message is shown THEN the system SHALL highlight or draw attention to the monitor element in the scene
3. WHEN the user scrolls between the introduction and guidance thresholds THEN the system SHALL show appropriate transitional content
4. IF the user scrolls back above the guidance threshold THEN the system SHALL revert to showing only the introduction message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the scroll-based system, I want smooth transitions between different scroll states, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between scroll states THEN the system SHALL animate message appearances and disappearances smoothly
2. WHEN scroll position changes THEN the system SHALL update the display state with appropriate timing and easing
3. WHEN multiple rapid scroll events occur THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without performance issues
4. WHEN the user stops scrolling THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state until the next scroll interaction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this portfolio, I want the scroll thresholds to be configurable, so that I can fine-tune the user experience without changing core logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the scroll system THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of scroll thresholds for different states
2. WHEN the scroll thresholds are modified THEN the system SHALL apply the new values without requiring code changes
3. WHEN invalid threshold values are provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and log appropriate warnings
4. IF threshold values conflict (e.g., guidance threshold less than intro threshold) THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully
