- [x] 2. Build IntroOverlay component
  - Create IntroOverlay component with fade-in/fade-out animations
  - Implement non-blocking overlay that allows continued scrolling
  - Add responsive styling for different screen sizes
  - Include auto-dismiss functionality with configurable timeout
  - Write unit tests for IntroOverlay component behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Build MonitorGuidance component
  - Create MonitorGuidance component with animated pointer/arrow
  - Implement 3D-aware positioning that tracks monitor location
  - Add pulsing animation to draw user attention
  - Include contextual message about monitor interaction
  - Write unit tests for MonitorGuidance positioning and animations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Create ScrollProgressIndicator component
  - Build progress indicator showing current stage in scroll journey
  - Implement smooth transitions between progress states
  - Add stage labels and minimal visual design
  - Position indicator unobtrusively in screen corner
  - Write unit tests for progress indicator state management
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Implement ScrollIntroManager component
  - Create ScrollIntroManager to orchestrate the scroll-based flow
  - Implement scroll event listeners with throttling for performance
  - Add logic for managing overlay display timing and transitions
  - Include scroll lock coordination with existing system
  - Handle stage transitions based on scroll thresholds
  - Write unit tests for scroll detection and stage management
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Integrate scroll system with existing App.jsx
  - Modify App.jsx to use ScrollIntroManager instead of direct scroll handling
  - Replace existing AboutOverlay with new IntroOverlay component
  - Add MonitorGuidance component to render when appropriate stage is reached
  - Include ScrollProgressIndicator in the main app layout
  - Ensure existing camera animations and Game Boy interactions remain functional
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Add scroll event performance optimizations
  - Implement scroll event throttling using requestAnimationFrame
  - Add debouncing for rapid scroll changes to prevent flickering
  - Optimize overlay component rendering with React.memo
  - Implement lazy loading for overlay components until first scroll
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write integration tests for complete scroll flow from start to Game Boy activation
  - Test scroll threshold accuracy and stage transition logic
  - Verify overlay timing and animation behavior
  - Test scroll lock functionality during overlay display
  - Add tests for configuration validation and error handling
  - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Add accessibility and mobile support
  - Implement keyboard navigation alternatives to scrolling
  - Add ARIA labels and screen reader support for overlays
  - Adjust scroll thresholds and overlay sizing for mobile devices
  - Test touch scroll behavior and momentum handling
  - Add support for reduced motion preferences
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Final integration and polish
  - Ensure smooth transitions between all scroll states
  - Verify camera coordination with new overlay system
  - Test complete user journey from initial scroll to Game Boy interaction
  - Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling
  - Optimize bundle size and loading performance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
