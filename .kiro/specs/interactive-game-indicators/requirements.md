# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds interactive visual indicators to the 3D space that allow users to discover and launch retro games, along with a scroll guidance indicator that appears when users first visit the site. The goal is to enhance user experience by making games more discoverable and providing clear navigation guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the site for the first time, I want to see a clear indication that I should scroll down, so that I can discover the interactive content below.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site loads for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a scroll indicator at the bottom of the viewport
2. WHEN the user scrolls down THEN the system SHALL hide the scroll indicator immediately
3. WHEN 5 seconds pass without user interaction THEN the system SHALL automatically hide the scroll indicator
4. WHEN the scroll indicator is visible THEN it SHALL include animated visual cues (bouncing arrow) and text "SCROLL TO EXPLORE"
5. WHEN the scroll indicator is displayed THEN it SHALL use the retro/matrix theme styling consistent with the site

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user exploring the 3D space, I want to see visual indicators for interactive games, so that I can easily discover and access the retro games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 3D scene loads THEN the system SHALL display game indicator emojis at appropriate positions in the 3D space
2. WHEN a user hovers over a game indicator THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (size increase, glow effect)
3. WHEN a user clicks on a game indicator THEN the system SHALL launch the corresponding retro game
4. WHEN game indicators are displayed THEN they SHALL have a floating animation to draw attention
5. WHEN game indicators are positioned THEN they SHALL be placed near relevant 3D objects (like the Game Boy on the desk)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with game indicators, I want smooth and responsive visual feedback, so that the interface feels polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over game indicators THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions for size and glow effects
2. WHEN game indicators animate THEN they SHALL use CSS animations that don't impact performance
3. WHEN multiple game indicators are present THEN each SHALL be independently interactive
4. WHEN game indicators are clicked THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback before launching the game
